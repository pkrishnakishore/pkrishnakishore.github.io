      <div class="description-box">
        <p>This evaluation evidence map was prepared by the UNSDG System-Wide Evaluation Office (SWEO). It aims to improve access to the extensive evaluation evidence generated by UN entities in the context of system-wide and intergovernmental policy discussions, including the 2024 Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review (QCPR), in line with the provisions of General Assembly resolution 78/166 (2023).</p>

        <p>The map features 701 evaluations published by UN system entities between January 2021 and April 2024 organised by country or territory of focus. It includes country, regional, emergency response, joint programmes and pooled funding, and global evaluations. Multi-country or global evaluations are tagged to all countries/territories for which specific data collection and analysis was conducted. Global evaluations without focus countries/territories are excluded. Some existing syntheses and summaries of evidence from multiple evaluations are also included.</p>

        <p>Geographic tagging of evaluation reports was conducted with the assistance of artificial intelligence. Testing and quality assurance throughout the development process provided a relatively high level of confidence in the results. However, inaccuracies and errors may be present.</p>

        <p>The UNSDG System-Wide Evaluation Office coordinated this initiative with substantive contributions of funding and management time by IFAD, UNDP, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF and WFP.</p>

        <p>The series also includes interactive evaluation evidence maps categorising evaluations by Sustainable Development Goal and QCPR priority area (links above) and evidence summaries and briefs on five topics.</p>
</p>

        <p>The complete series is available at:
